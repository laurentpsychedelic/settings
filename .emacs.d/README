This repository handles settings I use for software development on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) machines.
It includes GNU Emacs settings and various shell configuration files.
All files can be used from inside the directory, by installing symbolics links (hard links -junction- on
Win32) by running installation scripts in the "scripts" folder.
